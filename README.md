# Rubiks Cube Simulator

Rubik's cube simulator writes in Python/C extension focusing on high code performance.

## utils

Rubiks cube can simulate your actual situation on your real cube.

You can move cube like commonly rubiks cube notation

Moves are in the [moves.py](https://github.com/elkamill0/rubiks-cube-python/blob/main/moves.py) file

- **find_cross(length)** - you can find all possible crosses on the bottom side to a predefined max length
- **sequence(string)** - you can put moves like "R U B' F2" and program will make a sequence
- **f2l()** - program could find all possible f2l solutions (still in progress)

## Example file

I located an [example file](https://github.com/elkamill0/rubiks-cube-python/blob/main/main.py) how this program works
